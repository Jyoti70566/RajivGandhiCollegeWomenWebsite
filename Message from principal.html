  Life is another name of struggle dynamism and consciouses are its chief pillars if we follow shri<br>
  Madbagwat Gita's credo of selfless karma,we shall definitely be able to knock at the doors of<br>
  success, the chief in life are expectations if happiness and fear of sorrow.<br>

  <br>The cycle of joy-grief-hope-desperation goes on and this is perhaps what we mean by life.<br>
  However, we must strive for ourselves and for others.<br>
  
  <br>Dear students you are in the golden phase of your life.<br>
  Now is the time when with the help of self-confidence,patience, firm determination, and hard work you <br>
  can dream of achieving the impossible. If you have a glimpse of all-around find development and<br>
  achievement of the college.<br>
  
  <br>We are determined to make progress in a constant manner, we are obliged for all round <br>
  development of the personality of the student. We don't believe in action for action speaks louder than<br>
  words. I wish you all a bright future and confidentelly believe that you would touch the pinnacles of<br>
  success in life.<br>
